## Dataset
We are using the Unification Project dataset. This set includes K-12 financial, enrollment, and achievement data from all around the country. Data ranges from 1992 to 2017 and there are entries for every state. Columns include financial data (such as state and federal revenue), achievement data (such as average Math 4 scores), and enrollment statistics (number of students per grade and their demographics).

This group aims to use this dataset to explore the state of education in the U.S. We would like to compare the amount invested in education and associated resources in every state and see how/if that affects academic achievement. There are great disparities in the realm of education in our country and we wish to delve deeper in the factors at play.
